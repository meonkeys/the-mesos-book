# Introduction

*Apache Mesos* is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation
and sharing across distributed applications, or *frameworks*. It can run
[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org),
[MPI](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2),
[Hypertable](http://hypertable.org), [Spark](http://www.spark-project.org) (a
new framework for low-latency interactive and iterative jobs), and other
applications. Mesos is open source in the [Apache
Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org).

That's it for now, so please be sure to check out the [ending](#colophon).
